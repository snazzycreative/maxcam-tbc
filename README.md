# MaxCam
A dead simple addon that automatically enables maximum camera distance.

## Why Do I Need This?
WoW's default camera distance is quite close to your character, making it difficult to see around you. This makes fights that require situational awareness more difficult than necessary. Once installed, you will be able to zoom out from your character much further than before.

You don't need this addon if you're using one that already runs this script. For example, [LazyPig](https://github.com/Flierr/LazypigTBC) does this already.

## How it Works
You can install this addon into your `WoW/Interface/Addons` directory instead of having to run the below script each time you log in. There are no settings or commands. It just works.

```
/script console=SetCVar("cameraDistanceMax", 50)
```
## Requirements
You need to be running WoW version 2.4.3 to use this addon.
